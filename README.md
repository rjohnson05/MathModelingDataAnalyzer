# International Mathematical Modeling Contest Data Preparation

This program allows a user to provide a valid .csv file containing data from the Math Modeling Contest. This contest allows teams to compete internationally to create the best mathematical models to explain one of a
set of assigned problems. This file must contain the necessary columns for both institution and team data, including the following: Institution, Team Number, City, State/Province, Country, Advisor, Problem, & Ranking.
Once a valid .csv file with the neccesary columns has been provided, two separate .csv files are created, one containing data concerning institutions and the other data concerning teams. These files are saved in the
root level of this project. A sample .csv file has been provided, titled *2015.csv*. 

To run this program, first clone this project with the command `git clone https://github.com/rjohnson05/MathModelingDataPreparation`.
Make sure that you have Python installed on your machine, which can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that you are in the root directory of the cloned project and start the program by running `py main.py`.
